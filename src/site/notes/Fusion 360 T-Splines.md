###### T-Spline modeling in Fusion 360 combines the organic flexibility of subdivision surfaces with NURBS precision, enabling intuitive creation of complex, smooth forms through push-pull operations.

##### Once you have read through that, it is time to start modeling.

- Start by making the defining features of your model. Start off with the most similar shape from the **Form > Create** panel.
- Set up [[Fusion 360 T-Spline Symmetry\|Fusion 360 T-Spline Symmetry]]
- Start modifying the shapes. Delete faces, move vertices, edges, or faces with the [[Fusion 360 Edit Form\|Fusion 360 Edit Form]] command. [[Fusion 360 T-Spline Modifications\|Fusion 360 T-Spline Modifications]]
