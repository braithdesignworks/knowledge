## Step 1: Sketch 1
Start by creating a sketch on the front plane of the origin. Click create sketch in the top left of the app, and it should show 3 orange squares along with the X, Y, and Z axes. Looking at the front (X/Z) plane, you should see your [[Brain/Fusion 360 Interface#^f1cb41\|View Cube]] displaying "front" facing you. Click on that orange rectangle to create the sketch on that plane.
Then recreate this sketch:

This sketch started as the outermost rectangle created as a [[Fusion 360 Sketch Rectangle#^290756\|center point rectangle]].
