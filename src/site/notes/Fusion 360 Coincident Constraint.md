## Coincident

The **Coincident** tool constrains the position of two points or a point and a line or curve together.

This could be a point constrained along a line, two points constrained to each other, or a point constrained along a curve.

###### Note that the point and line segment do NOT have to be touching. This constrains it to the 'line' in the mathematical tense - an infinitely long line.
