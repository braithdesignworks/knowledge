# Rectangles in sketches

The rectangle tools in the **Sketch > Create** panel let you create different types of rectangles as sketch geometry or construction geometry in an active sketch in Fusion.

You can use the following tools to create rectangles in an active sketch:

- **2-Point Rectangle** ![2-point rectangle icon](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/Fusion-Sketch/images/icon/skt/rectangle-2-point.png)
- **3-Point Rectangle** ![3-point rectangle icon](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/Fusion-Sketch/images/icon/skt/rectangle-3-point.png)
- **Center Rectangle** ![center rectangle icon](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/Fusion-Sketch/images/icon/skt/rectangle-center.png)

Note: Before you can create sketch geometry, you must use the **Create Sketch** tool ![create sketch icon](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/Fusion-Sketch/images/icon/skt/create.png) to create a new sketch or right-click an existing sketch and select **Edit Sketch** to enter the **Sketch** contextual environment.

## 2-Point Rectangle

The **2-Point Rectangle** tool creates a rectangle defined 2 points. The 2 points are opposite corners of the rectangle.

You click to place the first corner point, then click to place the second corner point. Alternatively, you can specify the width and height values.

## 3-Point Rectangle

The **3-Point Rectangle** tool creates a rectangle defined by 3 points. The 3 points define the width, direction, and height of the rectangle.

You click to place the first corner point, then click to place the second point. Alternatively, you can specify the first distance value, then click to place the point. Then you click to place the third point or specify the second distance value.

## Center Rectangle

The **Center Rectangle** tool creates a rectangle defined by the center point and one corner point.

You click to place the first point as the center of the rectangle, then click to place a corner point or specify width and height values.
