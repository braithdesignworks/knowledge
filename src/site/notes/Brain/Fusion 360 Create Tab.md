## Create Sketch
Create sketch allows you to create a 2-dimensional sketch on a surface. On a new document, once you click *Create Sketch,* by default, Fusion will show you your origin planes. Once you have some objects, you can also click a flat face of any object to create a sketch on that.

## Extrude (E)
Extrude takes a shape you have already drawn (*or even any flat surface on any objects you have created*) and, well, extrudes it.
