## 1. Rotate manipulator

Acts as a plane-constrained rotate. Rotate the selected entities around a single axis (X, Y or Z axis). When rotating form entities, make sure the geometry doesn’t twist through itself, because a geometry with self-intersecting faces cannot be later converted into a solid model.

## 2. Single axis arrow manipulator

Acts as an axis-constrained move. Move selected form entities in a single axis direction which means they can be pushed or pulled along the X, Y or Z axis.

## 3. Single direction dash manipulator

Acts as an axis-constrained scale. Scale the selected geometry in a single direction.

## 4. Planar direction corner manipulator

Acts as a plane-constrained scale. Scale the selected entities along the XY, XZ or YZ plane.

## 5. Planar direction square manipulator

Acts as a plane-constrained move. Move the selected geometry freely around the XY, XZ or YZ plane.

## 6. Universal scaling center manipulator

Acts as a global scale. Scale the selected geometry in all directions.

## Hold `Alt` or `Option` to add geometry

Hold `Alt` (Windows), `Option` (MacOS) to add new geometry while dragging. This is best used in conjunction with center, square, and arrow manipulators. This is one of the single most important tools in **Edit Form**, and allows you to go from a primitive shape to a highly complex model in a matter of minutes. Hold `Alt+Ctrl` (Windows), `Option+Command` (MacOS) to maintain creases while adding geometry.

## Tips

- Drag the manipulator to start forming the shape of the body. Each manipulator performs a different modification:
    - Center manipulator acts as a global scale.
    - Square manipulator acts as a plane-constrained move.
    - Arrow manipulator acts as an axis-constrained move.
    - Dash manipulator acts as an axis-constrained scale.
    - Corner manipulator acts as a plane-constrained scale.
    - Rotate manipulator acts as a plane-constrained rotate.
- Click a face then double-click an adjacent face to select a loop of faces.Double-click an edge to select the loop of edges. Double-click a face to select the entire body.
