This is the dialogue box for the extrude tool. Here's what everything is:
## Type
Determines whether to create a solid body extrusion or a shell. 99% of the time, you want solid body.
## Profiles
With the "Select" box highlighted blue, click any, or multiple, closed shapes (in a sketch, or a flat surface) that you want to extrude. Keep in mind, if you are selecting multiple, they all need  to be *co-planar*.
## Start
**99% of the time, leave at default (Profile Plane).** If you are wanting to offset your shape, you can choose offset, to space out your extrusion from the shape selected. Object is similar to offset, but lets you choose another plane to offset to (so you do't have to do the math). 

## Direction
Direction lets you choose which directions to extrude. *Note that it won't flip the direction that the extrusion comes off of the face. Change your distance to a negative value to do that.*
Use this to choose whether to extrude in 2 directions, both **symmetrically** and **asymmetrically**.
